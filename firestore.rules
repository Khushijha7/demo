/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the FinanceFlow application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: Financial accounts owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Transactions for each account.
 * - /users/{userId}/savingsGoals/{savingsGoalId}: Savings goals defined by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - All write operations are strictly limited to the owning user.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document data is enforced on create and update.
 * - Flexible on data shapes for prototyping.
