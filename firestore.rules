/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for FinanceFlow
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 *  including user profile, accounts, transactions, and savings goals.
 * @data_structure Data is nested under /users/{userId}, creating a clear hierarchy of ownership.
 *  Accounts, transactions, and savings goals are stored as subcollections under each user.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed.
 *   - All data is private to the user, enforced by path-based rules.
 *   - No admin roles are defined.
